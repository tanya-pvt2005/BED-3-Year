In our case, right now even index.html file is in the server
index.html, css and js files are all static/public files since no backend operation like adding in db etc
Browser is the client, even to access html file, it needs to send request to server
In our case server sends the file

it demands endpoint everytime - > which is hectic to make get request for all components, hence we put all static content in public folder
we send entire public folder to browser
